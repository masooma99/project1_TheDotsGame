How to Play

* The setup is already made for you when you open the website.
* Turns
  * Players take turns drawing a single horizontal or vertical line to connect two adjacent, unconnected dots.
* Capturing Boxes
  * If you draw a line that completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box, you fill in that box (usually with your initial) and immediately get to take another turn.
* Winning
  * The game ends when all possible lines are drawn. The player with the most initials (boxes) on the board wins.



Key Strategies

* Avoid Finishing Three Sides
  * Try not to draw a line that leaves three sides of a box open, as your opponent will immediately take it.
* Create Chains
  * When possible, force your opponent into a position where they must complete one box, allowing you to take all the other boxes in that "chain".
